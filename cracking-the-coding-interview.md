## Resume
For each role, try to discuss your accomplishments with the following approach: "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to z". Here's an example: 

•  Reduced object rendering time by 75% by implementing distributed caching, leading to a 10% reduction in log-in time.

•  Increased average match accuracy from 1.2 to 1.5 by implementing a new comparison algorithm basedon windiff.

Not everything you did will fit into this approach, but the principle is the same: show what you did, how you did it, and what the results were. 
Ideally, you should try to make the results "measurable" somehow.

## Questions to ask
 These questions will give you a good feel for what the day-to-day life is like at the company. 
 1. "What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?"
 2. "What brought you to this company? What has been most challenging for you?"
 
 These questions demonstrate your knowledge or understanding of technology. 
 1. "I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"
 2. "Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, B,C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue o:'

These questions are designed to demonstrate your passion for technology. They show that you're interested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company. 
1.  'I'm very interested in scalability, and I'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this company to learn about this?"
2. "I'm not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?

## Interview
### Limit Details
Stay light on details and just state the key points. When possible, try to translate it or at least explain the impact. You can always offer the interviewer the opportunity to drill in further.
"By examining the most common user behavior and applying the Rabin-Karp algorithm, I designed a new algorithm to reduce search from O(n) to 0( log n) in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you'd like:' 

## Focus on You, not the Team
Pay attention to your answers. Listen for how much you say "we" versus 'T' Assume that every question is about your role, and speak to that.

## Structured Answer
Nugget First means starting your response with a "nugget" that succinctly describes what your response will be about. 
Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change:' 
Candidate:"Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach their own courses. Initially, my school had a rule where .. :'

S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result) The S.A.R. approach means that you start off outlining the situation, then explaining the actions you took, and lastly, describing the result.

## Tell me About Yourself
A typical structure that works well for many people is essentially chronological, with the opening sentence describing their current job and the conclusion discussing their relevant and interesting hobbies outside of work. 

1.Current Role [Headline Only]: "I'm a software engineer at  Microworks, where I've been leading theAndroid team for the last five years:'

2.College: My background is in computer science. I did my undergrad at  Berkeley and spent a few summers working at startups, including one where I attempted to launch my own business.

3.Post College & Onwards: After college, I wanted to get some exposure to larger corporations so I joined Amazon as a developer. It was a great experience. I learned a ton about large system design and I got toreally drive the launch of a key part of AWS. That actually showed me that I really wanted to be in a more entrepreneurial environment. 

4.Current Role [Details]: One of my old managers from Amazon recruited me out to join her startup, which was what brought me to Microworks. Here, I did the initial system architecture, which has scaledpretty well with our rapid growth. I then took an opportunity to lead the Android team. I do manage ateam of three, but my role is primarily with technical leadership: architecture, coding, etc.

5.Outside of Work: Outside of work, I've been participating in some hackathons-mostly doing iOSdevelopment there as a way to learn it more deeply. I'm also active as a moderator on online forumsaround Android development.

6.Wrap Up: I'm looking now for something new, and your company caught my eye. I've always loved theconnection with the user, and I really want to get back to a smaller environment too.

## Big O
When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem space gets halved each time, that will likely be a 0(log N) runtime. 

### Time Complexity
Using transfering file as an example:
Electronic Transfer: 0(s), where s is the size of the file. This means that the time to transfer the file increases linearly with the size of the file. (Yes, this is a bit of a simplification, but that's okay for these purposes.) 
Airplane Transfer: 0( 1) with respect to the size of the file. As the size of the file increases, it won't take any longer to get the file to your friend. The time is constant. 

## Space Complexity
Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require 0(n) space. If we need a two-dimensional array of size nxn, this will require O(n2) space.


## Negotiation 

1. Just Do It. Yes, I know it's scary; (almost) no one likes negotiating. But it's so, so worth it. Recruiters will notrevoke an offer because you negotiated, so you have little to lose. 
This is especially true if the offer is froma larger company. You probably won't be negotiating with your future teammates.

2. Have a Viable Alternative. Fundamentally, recruiters negotiate with you because they're concerned youmay not join the company otherwise. 
If you have alternative options, that will make their concern muc hmore real.

3. Have a Specific "Ask": It's more effective to ask for an additional $7000 in salary than to just ask for "more:'.

4. Overshoot: In negotiations, people usually don't agree to whatever you demand. It's a back and forthconversation. Ask for a bit more than you're really hoping to get, since the company will probably meetyou in the middle.

5. Think Beyond Salary: Companies are often more willing to negotiate on non-salary components, sinceboosting your salary too much could mean that they're paying you more than your peers. Considerasking for more equity or a bigger signing bonus. 
Alternatively, you may be able to ask for your reloca­tion benefits in  cash, instead of having the company pay directly for the moving fees. This is a greatavenue for many college students, whose actual moving expenses are fairly cheap.
