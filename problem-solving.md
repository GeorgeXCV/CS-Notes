# Problem Solving Apporoach

## Understand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve to the problem? Might not know until start solving.
5 How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

## Concrete Examples
Practice calling function and write expected output
Try the above with edge cases-  empty input, null etc.

## Break It Down
Write out the steps you need to take.

## Solve or Simplify
Solve the problem, if you can't solve smaller problem, then incorportate the diffculty back in.

# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counters
Use objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. 

Break down the contents of array or string, then can quickly compare.

## Multiple Pointers
We have a structure like Array or Linked List and want to search for a pair of values that meet a condition.

## Sliding Window
Creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
