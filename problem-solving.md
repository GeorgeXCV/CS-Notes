## Understand the Problem
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve to the problem? Might not know until start solving.
5 How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

## Concrete Examples
Practice calling function and write expected output
Try the above with edge cases-  empty input, null etc.
