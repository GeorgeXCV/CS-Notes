# Computer Science
## Big O
Big O is the way we analyze how efficient algorithms. We can model how much time any function is going to take given n inputs, but in reality we're interested in the order of magnitude of the number and necessarily of the exact figure.
Only care about huge difference, if function is 300ms vs 330 ms, whatever. But 500ms vs 30 seconds is huge. We ignore the little parts and concentrate on the big parts.

With 3x² + x + 1, the Big O for this equation would be O(n²) where O is just absorbing all the other fluff (including the factor on the biggest term.) Just grab the biggest term. So for n terms, it's going take us n*n time to go through our inputs. 

 This is O(n) because we go through all the inputs once in a loop. 
```
function crossAdd(input) {
    var answer = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        var goingUp = input[i];
        var goingDown = input[input.length-1-i];
        answer.push(goingUp + goingDown);
    }
    return answer;
}
```

 This would be O(n²). For every input, we have to go through a full loop inside of another full loop, meaning we're doing a lot of work! This is the trick: look for loops. A loop inside of a loop inside of a loop would likewise be O(n³).

If we have no loops and just do something and exit/return, then it's said we're doing it in constant time, or O(1). 
```
function makeTuples(input) {
    var answer = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        for (var j = 0; j < input.length; j++) {
            answer.push([input[i], input[j]]);
        }
    }
    return answer;
}
```
## Recursion
Recursion is when you define something in terms of itself.

When we talk about recursion in computer science, we are talking about a function that calls itself. This technique is especially adept at some problems because of its ability to maintain state at different levels of recursion.

While recursion can make the code very simple for some problems, it inherently carries a potentially large footprint with it as every time you call the function, it adds another call to the stack. Some problems therefore are better solved in a slightly-more-complicated-but-more-effecient way of iteration (loops) instead of recursion. 

Function that computes a factorial recursively: 
```
function factorial(num) {
  if (num < 2) return 1;
  return num * factorial(num-1);
}
```
A factorial is when you take a number n and multiply by each preceding integer until you hit one.
