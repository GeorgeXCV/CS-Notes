# Web Application & Software Architecture

## Single Tier Applications
A single-tier application is an application where the user interface, backend business logic & the database all reside in the same machine.

Typical examples of single-tier applications are desktop applications like MS Office, PC Games or an image editing software like Gimp.

## Two Tier Applications
A Two-tier application involves a client and a server. The client would contain the user interface & the business logic in one machine. And the backend server would be the database running on a different machine. The database server is hosted by the business & has control over it.

## Three Tier Applications
Three-tier applications are pretty popular & largely used in the industry. Almost all of the simple websites like blogs, news websites etc. are part of this category.

So, if we take the example of a simple blog, the user interface would be written using Html, JavaScript, CSS, the backend application logic would run on a server like Apache & the database would be MySQL. A three-tier architecture works best for simple use cases.

## N-Tier Application
An application which has more than three components involved, these components could be:
* Cache
* Message queues for asynchronous behaviour
* Load balancers
* Search servers for searching through massive amounts of data
* Components involved in processing massive amounts of data
* Components running heterogeneous tech commonly known as web services etc.

All the social applications like Instagram, Facebook, large scale industry services like Uber, Airbnb, online massive multiplayer games like Pokemon Go, applications with fancy features are n-tier applications.
